* [Closest Airport to an Address](https://github.com/benhunter/py-stuff/blob/master/closest_airport.py) - Take a geopgraphic address and find the closest airport to it. Uses geopy to convert to coordinates and [kdtree](https://github.com/benhunter/py-stuff/blob/master/kdtree.py) algorithm to find the nearest airport. Requires a sqlite3 database setup by [sqlite3_hello.py](https://github.com/benhunter/py-stuff/blob/master/sqlite3_hello.py). Uses the airport data from [OpenFlights.org](https://openflights.org/data.html).
