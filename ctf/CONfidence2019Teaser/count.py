You know that I am called the Count
Because I really love to count
I could sit and count all day
Sometimes I get carried away
I count slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster
Once I've started counting it's really hard to stop
Faster, faster. It is so exciting!
I could count forever, count until I drop
1! 2! 3! 4!
1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4,
1-2, i love couning whatever the ammount haha!
1-2-3-4, heyyayayay heyayayay that's the sound of the count
I count the spiders on the wall...
I count the cobwebs in the hall...
I count the candles on the shelf...
When I'm alone, I count myself!
I count slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster
Once I've started counting it's really hard to stop
Faster, faster. It is so exciting!
I could count forever, count until I drop
1! 2! 3! 4!
1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1,
2 I love counting whatever the
ammount! 1-2-3-4 heyayayay heayayay 1-2-3-4
That's the song of the Count!
